# Medical Analyzer in VR

## Introduction

According to a recent report, India produces approximately around 50,000 new doctors each year. And with so many doctors trying to practise and achieve expertise in their respective fields, the number of subjects on which they can practise surgery is an alarming low number. Every other day we come across disaster stories of medical frauds that lead to loss of precious human lives. This loss of lives also comes due to the fact that sometimes the monitoring devices used in the hospitals are quite old and don’t function properly. This might be disastrous in some situations more than the rest. Our project aims at reducing these problems by providing doctors with an advanced, state of the art mechanism to monitor the patient’s bio-signals or vitals as they are called. Also, with machine learning integrated into our VR app for various object detection, focusing primarily on human anatomy, our module would try to provide a way for the amateur doctors to get a first-hand and detailed knowledge of the instruments used in an operating theatre thereby reducing the scope of errors.

## Objective

- To design and prototype a device that acts as a “Virtual Monitoring Assistant” by providing customizable information of the patient’s vitals.
- To have object detection integrated well inside the application to provide seamles knowledge of the object at first glance.
- Reduce the need for monitoring systems in hospitals replacing them with the VR versions of the same.

## Need

When in a hospital, there is a constant battle between life and death. And in such scenarios, even the slightest of errors can prove to be fatal and can result into death. These errors can be human errors or technical glitches. As for human errors, those are beyond our reach but we can definitely try to reduce technical glitches. Sometimes these technical faults arise due to faulty monitoring devices giving incorrect information. Our project aims at reducing such errors and also proving object detection functionality to amateur doctors regarding various instruments found in an operation theatre.

## Features

- `Easily Accessible Data` : Data regarding human body vitals is easily accessible.
- `Reducing Hardware` : The hardware used for monitoring a patient’s vitals will be significantly reduced and will be replaced by our application.
- `Smart Object Detection`: With machine learning capabilities present in our application, the amateur doctors will have a better understanding of what is what in an operation theatre.

## Benefits

- `Customizable` : The current module shows the vitals for heart rate but the application can be used for monitoring any vital that can be specified by the doctor given a appropriate sensor.
- `Multitasking` : The doctor in question could in fact do multiple tasks rather than just spending time monitoring the vitals of the patient. With the vitals right in front of his eyes, he could do more than one task at the same time.
- `User Friendly` : The application is user friendly as it enables user to operate the application to get specific information with ease.
- `State of the Art` : Augmented Reality is completely new and this will provide an edge to other conventional monitoring systems thereby making the complete process state of the art.
